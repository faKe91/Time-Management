Time Management allows you to keep track of what you are doing on your PC. 
I plan on using it to help me fill out my timesheet at the office. 
The application resides in the systray, and writes to a CSV file each 
time you switch applications, or the title bar of the current app changes.

File format:
[date],[time],[process name],[window title],[duration used]

There is no built in reporting capability, but a simple Excel pivot table produces a 
spectacular table and chart. I'd assume Open Office has a similar feature.
